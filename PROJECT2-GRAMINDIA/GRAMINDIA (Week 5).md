### [1. Unemployment](#table-of-contents)

**Pottery:** Buying separate sets of tools is costly. We can look at the net benefit we can expect by providing a fixed number of potters access to common tools and techniques. Even if by equipping each with the tools we may be in profit but that requires a high fixed cost. We have to consider this factor too.

**Tourist guidance:** Making youths learn languages like English and some foreign languages can coincide with training for jobs like call center jobs and related jobs in this field. So collective costs of these activities can be reduced. Similarly, those youths wishing for any job in the history/ geographical field (like govt. jobs) who will be wishing to learn could be targeted. Also, systematic arrangements could be made with the help of apps/websites which will help tourist guides with all the knowledge regarding transportation and hotel stays at nearby sites. most tourists in India are domestic in nature, along with foreign languages, other regional languages like Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, or Marathi also can be learned.

**Sericulture:** Since, sericulture is mainly done in rural areas, people use outdated technologies in it. Also, primitive and unscientific reeling and weaving techniques are high in use, which decreases its production. That's why modern types of equipment like sprinklers, portrays, humidifiers, etc. should be used. Its production is less also, because of the use of poor quality seeds, which can be treated by: revolving the capital fund, purchasing seed testing equipment for seed production centers, and up-gradation of production units. These should be promoted by govt. in vocational training courses.
The PM Free Silai Machine Yojana could be improved by running it in a loop. Once they have earned enough money, the women who were given sewing machines by the government can hire other women. The money they make can be used to buy new sewing machines and start a community. This would create more jobs while reducing the burden on government funding. We can begin small-scale projects in which we provide women with initial starter training and materials. Following that, women can begin sewing simple clothes and selling them to local authorities. Some of the benefits will go to the project holder, which will help us expand the project and make it more effective in the long run.

### Food Security

-   **Food availability:** Food availability means that people must have access to sufficient quantities of healthy and good-quality food. This can be done by improving crop productivity by using cross-breed crops, better irrigation facilities, soil monitoring, and shifting to modern agricultural practices. This agriculture-related section has been looked at in the professions section in previous reports.
-   **Food access:** Includes reducing post-harvest loss by improving storage, refrigeration, transport, etc., and building a better distribution system to ensure that each individual has access to a sufficiently healthy and nutritious diet.
- **Food use and utilization:** Food utilization ensures that other than having access to good quality food, people eat a diversity of foods to meet their nutritional needs by eating a balanced diet rich in every essential nutrient.

#### Food access:

Since crops grow seasonally, food storage solutions are required to maintain a regular and sustainable supply of food throughout the year. Some potential solutions for food access issues can be:
-   Due to high upfront cost, setting silos or warehouses is difficult for small farmers therefore affordable off-grid solar powered hermetic storage solutions or affordable configurable aeration mechanisms can help farmers for better storage.    
-   ML-based aeration mechanism that can be attached to any food truck for food storage to control temperature, humidity, and ethylene levels can help in making a robust cold chain for food transportation.
- Software-based community service to connect people in rural areas connecting service providers and people needing service leading to an efficient supply chain. Like a community network platform to connect transportation services, storage providers, and farmers. For example, a carriage booking and sharing app to maximize the efficiency of the logistic chain.  
-   The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can tackle the problems of the current food supply chain like food wastage, bulk production, food preservation, food adulteration, supply-demand matching, fraud prevention, and counterfeiting. The use of data-driven collaborative forecasting of demand can help in effective supply-demand matching. Effective product tracking and tracing, and synchronization of freight transport through better transport scheduling can compress the time along the supply chain. Improving logistics, loading, and unloading facilities, connecting logistic companies with producers for better transportation of food.

#### Food use and utilization:

According to a paper published in the journal food policy based on 2011 census data, 3 out of 4 people living in rural India cannot afford a nutritious diet. Even if they spent their entire income on food, almost 2 out of 3 would not be able to afford the cheapest possible diet fulfilling requirements. 330 gm of cereals, 75 gm of pulses a day, 300 gm of dairy, 100 gm of fruit, and 300 gm of vegetables which should include at least 100 gm of dark green leafy vegetables are required for a nutritionally adequate diet for adult women as per the guidelines by the National Institute for Nutrition.

We know that the main factor in deciding how much a person needs to eat is calorific value but rarely is it seen from where those calorific values are getting, below table shows how much calorific value a portion of nuts, fresh fruits, and salads contain.

To ensure proper food utilization, people need a balanced diet consisting of all such essential nutrients with appropriate calories according to their level of activity and other things.
Some steps we can take to ensure proper food utilization in rural areas are:

-   An information program should be started in rural India, educating them on how much minimum food of various types they need to maintain a healthy lifestyle.   
-   A more village targeted logistics and planning system should be developed so that each village can grow whatever farmers are comfortable with ( planning as such a group of villages fulfill all dietary needs locally ), so that cost can be brought down ( logistical and transport, the whole village is in either support of one type of crop so supply chain cost can be brought down and increased specialization in that particular crop or fruit will increase productivity ).
-   A community kitchen can be established, where the village as a whole works as a single co-operative unit, and co-operative kitchen feeds the whole village, this will result in a more organized structure, thus it will be easy to maintain a nutrition profile.  
-   Free or cheap ration provided by Public Distribution System should also monitor the nutritional needs of a family through some portal or app which need to be updated by ration distributors in rural areas, and a predictive ML model should be implemented to predict the target of providing nutritious diet in each household eradicating the major problem of malnutrition.    
-   Awareness programs need to be conducted and strict monitoring on the nutritional level in maternal diet and diet of children in the age group of 1-5 needs to be done. Involvement of women is more important because meals of the family are looked after by mothers in rural India and women's participation encourages other women of the village also.
- Effective food utilization depends in large measure on knowledge within the household of food storage and processing techniques. This is because most people in rural areas have very little knowledge of how to store and refrigerate things. Therefore, proper awareness of refrigeration guidelines should be publicized using the packaging of packed food and using radio and tv commercials for no packaged food.

#### Long term self-sustaining solutions:

The extent of economic and political independence defines whether a particular region will thrive or not. This is the main key point in ensuring food security in rural areas. We have to make nutritious food economically and politically sustainable, not like the communist setup where micromanaging led to mass famines and malnutrition. We can have government-supported cooperative capitalism, where the government supports the creation of co-operatives that will run farms, schools, community kitchens as a corporate house for less than 40% of the partnership of government. The community kitchen and schools (which teaches about nutrition profile) should have village members as board members advised by an expert from the government or some NGO. Some of these cooperatives with the help of the government have a strong regional or even a national presence( for appropriate government partnership in profit, less than 50%).
These regional cooperatives will work with the government and private NGOs to make affordable food available to the rural people. Also along with bringing the cost down, the quality of crops should not be compromised. Specialized cross-breed crops with more nutritional value and dairy should be produced with the help of the government and these cooperatives to achieve self-reliance and thereby ensure food security.
