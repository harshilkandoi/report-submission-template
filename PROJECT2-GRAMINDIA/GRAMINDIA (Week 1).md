#### Who are the people we refer to as villagers?

 Women in Rural India constitute about half of the rural population. A little more than 48 per cent of the Indian rural population is female, according to the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011. 
 
#### How do they live?

Farmers, wage earners, and entrepreneurs are all essential positions for women in the rural economy. They are also responsible for the well-being of their family members, including providing food and caring for youngsters and the old. They are less often literate than their male counterparts. Typically, they don’t get to own land. Women work in agriculture, cattle, hunting, and forestry, among other traditional jobs and subsistence activities. They perform critical responsibilities in their communities as family caregivers and keepers of traditional knowledge, which is critical to their people's survival and integrity, as well as their livelihoods and resilience. 

#### What do they earn?

Rural women workers are less likely to engage in wage employment than women in urban areas, and when they do, they tend to earn less than their male counterparts. Rural women, on average, are paid 25 percent less than men, and they typically work longer hours. They are also often engaged in labor-intensive work under challenging conditions, lacking occupational safety and health measures and social protection.

#### How do they shop?

- 84% travel outside their village to nearby city or district headquarters to make purchases and bring the products home.
- Majority of rural women consumers buy high-value goods – which again is a myth buster for companies thinking that women mostly prefer to purchase low-value goods.
- 37% of the rural women consumers make purchases on their own. The figure is as high as 40% for working women in rural India.
    
#### How do they save?

The study identified that there are principally two major ways through which rural women save their finances. These are in cash or kind forms. The cash methods of saving include saving through banks, financial self-help associations, money lending, and house saving. The non-cash methods of saving include purchasing land, storage of agricultural produce, livestock investment, rentals, and building houses. Individual analysis showed that the non-cash method was the major way of saving by the rural women farmers. This was testified by the 90% and 60% of the women that save through non-cash and cash methods respectively. However, identified primary non-cash methods of saving were an investment in livestock production (88%) and storage of farm produce (78.4). The major cash methods of saving among the rural women farmers are; house saving (79.6%) and money lending (45.4%).

#### How do they spend their money?

For an average rural Indian, food accounted for 52.9% of their overall expenditure, including 10.8 percent for cereals and cereal substitutes, 8 percent for milk and milk products, 7.9 percent on beverages, refreshments, and processed food, and 6.6 percent on vegetables.
Among the non-food items, rural Indians spent about 8 percent on Fuel / Light, 7 percent on Clothing & Footwear, 6.7 percent on medical expenses, 3.5 percent on Education, 4.2 percent on conveyance, and 8.5 percent on consumer services and durables.
In this rural area, women mostly spend their money on Food, Clothing, and medical expenses.

####  What do they aspire to do?

- Some women might have hobbies like singing, dancing, acting or wants to play some sports for which the facilities are not available in villages.
- In villages, people think that the girl has to marry and go to her husband’s house so they don’t teach them. So girls don’t get higher or even basic education in villages through which they may become independent.
- Proper sanitization facilities are also not present in villages.

####  What are the most important resources they have?

- In the village, most of the women are homemakers, and they rely on their husband’s earnings.  
- They also help in agricultural work and collect wood or water for their family.

####  What do they Lack?

- Sanitation facilities  
- Basic facilities like fuel, tap water  
- Proper education (considerably less than male counterpart)  
- Financial independence

- Need of clean fuel (LPG)
- Access to equal education at a young age and no early stopping  
- Availability of some quick method to avoid reliance on male members of the family to shop daily necessity things
