Our Quest for a better rural India has lead us to the modelling of the rural india's problems and present some interventions to improve the quality of life. The village ecosystem can be thought of as a control system with every intervention having interdependent consequences in other domains of life which can be thought of as a non-linear system having multiple non-independent variables. To provide interventions at the community and inter-community level, we focus on six most important variables:- Unemployment, Education, Infrastructure, Healthcare, Food security, and general awareness. Considering the wide range of villages having various aspects in different domains, we didn't want to limit ourselves to a few of them, so we provided a generalised set of interventions some of which may be applicable to only a certain set of villages and the others may be applicable to another set of villages.
