### [Abstract](#table-of-contents)



### [1. Unemployment](#table-of-contents)

**Pottery:** Buying separate sets of tools is costly. We can look at the net benefit we can expect by providing a fixed number of potters access to common tools and techniques. Even if by equipping each with the tools we may be in profit but that requires a high fixed cost. We have to consider this factor too.

**Tourist guidance:** Making youths learn languages like English and some foreign languages can coincide with training for jobs like call center jobs and related jobs in this field. So collective costs of these activities can be reduced. Similarly, those youths wishing for any job in the history/ geographical field (like govt. jobs) who will be wishing to learn could be targeted. Also, systematic arrangements could be made with the help of apps/websites which will help tourist guides with all the knowledge regarding transportation and hotel stays at nearby sites. most tourists in India are domestic in nature, along with foreign languages, other regional languages like Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, or Marathi also can be learned.

**Sericulture:** Since, sericulture is mainly done in rural areas, people use outdated technologies in it. Also, primitive and unscientific reeling and weaving techniques are high in use, which decreases its production. That's why modern types of equipment like sprinklers, portrays, humidifiers, etc. should be used. Its production is less also, because of the use of poor quality seeds, which can be treated by: revolving the capital fund, purchasing seed testing equipment for seed production centers, and up-gradation of production units. These should be promoted by govt. in vocational training courses.
The PM Free Silai Machine Yojana could be improved by running it in a loop. Once they have earned enough money, the women who were given sewing machines by the government can hire other women. The money they make can be used to buy new sewing machines and start a community. This would create more jobs while reducing the burden on government funding. We can begin small-scale projects in which we provide women with initial starter training and materials. Following that, women can begin sewing simple clothes and selling them to local authorities. Some of the benefits will go to the project holder, which will help us expand the project and make it more effective in the long run.


### [2. Education](#table-of-contents)
To improve education quality in a village we are suggesting the following solutions.

-   **Providing free Internet connection with smartphones:**

    Since there is a lack of high-quality education in villages. So we
    can provide free internet connection under some government scheme.
    Using smartphones they can learn from the national level teachers.
    There are many platforms like Udemy, Coursera and Youtube that
    provides education with good teachers across the world. As per a
    recent survey done by ASER, 26.1% of rural families don’t have
    access to smartphones at home.(“27.9% Rural Households Bought
    Smartphone for Kids’ Studies Amid Pandemic: Survey” 2021)

    Smartphones should be configured in such a way that they can only be
    for educational purposes this will prevent misuse of smartphones.
    
    COST per village(500 families per village):  
    Smartphones: 500x6000 = 3L  
    Internet: 500x3000(per year plan) = 15L per year (3GB data per day for a year)  
    Total Cost: 3L(one time) + 15L(per year) for one village  
    
-   **Providing access to paid courses on the internet:**

    As most of the structured learning resources are paid on the
    internet. So, we can provide access to those paid courses at a
    subsidised rate so that they can afford it. They can acquire an
    organised, high-quality education through these paid classes,
    similar to what they would get at a premium school. This will have a
    great impact on the future of a student studying in a village with
    limited access to such premium institutions. Students from villages
    will also be able to compete with a student studying in the urban
    area having access to quality education.
    
    
    Cost per village(500 family per village):
    Course: 500*360(course price) = 1.8L per village

-   **Linking Individuals:**

    We can link various subject experts or students good at subjects
    with village students. The village students can’t have access to
    tuition or coaching facilities, so we can provide them with this
    help with students( like NSS) or various NGOs can be linked to it.
    In this way we can make a platform for villagers so that they can
    get access to such help.

-   **Encouraging Ed tech sector:**

    The government needs to encourage the Ed tech sector to provide
    services to students from rural areas as well. Clearly more needs to
    be done by the private sector such as making content available in
    regional languages, making services targeted towards the
    underprivileged etc. This could be done by providing tax benefits
    and government funding.

-   **Modern Education Centre:**

    Modern Education centres can be set up by Governments/Private
    Institutions to provide, where classes of different fields of expert
    teachers can be streamed live for mass students. Students, This
    facility can be used as schools or coaching for the various fields
    to get world-class teaching from the best teachers around the world.

-   **Better translation software for regional languages :**

    74 percent of children in India study in their mother tongue and
    this number is even higher in rural areas. Moreover, 44 percent of
    engineering students want to be taught in their mother tongue. This
    shows most students prefer to learn and are more comfortable in
    their mother tongue. However, most educational content - books,
    articles, videos, research papers - are in English. Furthermore,
    these increase and change at such a fast rate that it is impossible
    to manually translate all the content. Hence, better AI and NLP
    software will need to be developed. Over the last few years, OpenAI
    has made huge strides to make models with performance matching human
    language skills (GPT2 and more recently GPT3). Work will need to be
    done to use this model in regional language translation contexts and
    develop applications to do so.(*The Times of India* 2021) (“44%
    Engineering Students Want to Be Taught in Mother Tongue, Tamil Tops
    List: AICTE Survey” n.d.)
    
    
    
    
    
    Cost:  
    Time: 1 year  
    20 developers at 30 LPA = 6C  
    Operational cost = 2C  
    Computational cost = 2C  
    Total: 10C  
    







What are the specifications for technology interventions at the inter-community level?

- We can teach them basic communication skills in english or local language through which we can place them in customer FAQ section in companies. If they know their local language, then just a bit of training is required to make them communicate in a sophisticated manner and an effort to link them to such companies . This job can be done from anywhere like at your own place too. So this can be a solution.

    Cost- around 1500-2000 rs. Hence, it is a cost efficient solution.

  
- We can give stipends to students in schools. The reason that a large portion of rural kids don’t go to school is because they can contribute more (financially ) by working in a farm or helping in the household chores. Giving stipends to students (or their parents) solves this problem. This is similar to how we pay PhD students and research scholars at colleges. We can also make this stipend performance based (based on grades) or effort based (based on the work done or time spent) to ensure that children have an incentive to work hard. This solution will alleviate poverty and promote education.

    The cost can be around Rs 5,000 -10,000 per student per month. This may seem expensive but a more educated workforce will essentially pay for itself in the long run (by taxes and other contributions to the country’s growth). 


- Different coaching centres can be establised for students to learn real-world skills which are relevant for jobs such as Excel, AutoCAD etc. The government can subsidise the fees of coaching and can also establish government-run coaching centres similar to government schools. A good initiative for attracting more students in these institutions can be appointing teachers as someone from the same village who is eligible and have the required knowledge.

    The cost for establishment of such centres may cost around 1,00,000. But it can recovered and cost of the teachers and employees can be paid by the student fees. Students getting subsidy will cost the government Rs 5,000 -10,000 per student per month.


- Machine translation models using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing can be developed. Recent state-of-the-art models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 (developed by OpenAI) match human language skills competency on a multitude of tasks. Developing such a tool would greatly help rural kids access a wide range of knowledge (books, papers, articles) which are currently inaccessible since the majority of them are only in English and not in regional languages.

  Estimated Cost:
  Time: 1 year  
  20 developers at 30 LPA = 6Cr  
  Operational cost = 2Cr  
  Computational cost = 2Cr  
  Total: 10Cr  
  

### Sustainability of proposed interventions

We are introducing a committee to ensure the proper functioning of proposed interventions. The committee will consist of different teams having 2-4 members from the same village.

  

These are its following teams and its responsibility

  

1.  Finance Team: Some of the proposed interventions need a continuous flow of money.  And some of the interventions will charge some fees from villagers for its service. So, to manage the finance aspect, this team will be responsible. The finance team also introduce a service tax in the scheme provided by the committee to pay members with the salary as per govt guidelines.  
      
    
2.  Marketing Team: to spread the scheme in the village, a marketing team is necessary. It is important to me sure that everyone in the village is able to understand the goal and the steps taken by us. A great marketing team is what wins the support of the people. 
    

3.  Execution Team: The main task for any work is execution. The execution team will look after all the necessary things and logistic parts required. The execution team will take feedback at ground level and required changes can be made. Hence, execution team has to work for betterment and has to keep keen eye for modifications as well.
    

4.  Complaint Team: to handle complaints from the villagers. Complaints are inevitable. A team will be formed to take in, process and forward complaints to the appropriate teams. In any project, it is extremely important to take feedback and improve and fix.
    

5.  Research and Management Team: research the ongoing or new programme to give suggestions to the execution team,  Using the data such as number of students involved, skill developed etc of the existing programme, This team will analysis each programme and its outcome. Based on the performance and outcome of each programme, this team will suggest changes in each programme and suggest new programes for better output.

### Food Security

**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7Lyu_KouxOlD1kLaR9RoX-wXOxNHH0HdxE5keP2LUWeCmC7PFQXuYdx-ifvMABsrOIJoBWE4_GCRlsyfcNZzJc4JLJ_cBRPb3aLgg8FnyAWXRaMrXfuBwxzdqh-kcrEQmyLoGzT4)**

-   **Food availability:** Food availability means that people must have access to sufficient quantities of healthy and good-quality food. This can be done by improving crop productivity by using cross-breed crops, better irrigation facilities, soil monitoring, and shifting to modern agricultural practices. This agriculture-related section has been looked at in the professions section in previous reports.
-   **Food access:** Includes reducing post-harvest loss by improving storage, refrigeration, transport, etc., and building a better distribution system to ensure that each individual has access to a sufficiently healthy and nutritious diet.
- **Food use and utilization:** Food utilization ensures that other than having access to good quality food, people eat a diversity of foods to meet their nutritional needs by eating a balanced diet rich in every essential nutrient.

#### Food access:

Since crops grow seasonally, food storage solutions are required to maintain a regular and sustainable supply of food throughout the year. Some potential solutions for food access issues can be:
-   Due to high upfront cost, setting silos or warehouses is difficult for small farmers therefore affordable off-grid solar powered hermetic storage solutions or affordable configurable aeration mechanisms can help farmers for better storage.    
-   ML-based aeration mechanism that can be attached to any food truck for food storage to control temperature, humidity, and ethylene levels can help in making a robust cold chain for food transportation.
- Software-based community service to connect people in rural areas connecting service providers and people needing service leading to an efficient supply chain. Like a community network platform to connect transportation services, storage providers, and farmers. For example, a carriage booking and sharing app to maximize the efficiency of the logistic chain.  
-   The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can tackle the problems of the current food supply chain like food wastage, bulk production, food preservation, food adulteration, supply-demand matching, fraud prevention, and counterfeiting. The use of data-driven collaborative forecasting of demand can help in effective supply-demand matching. Effective product tracking and tracing, and synchronization of freight transport through better transport scheduling can compress the time along the supply chain. Improving logistics, loading, and unloading facilities, connecting logistic companies with producers for better transportation of food.

#### Food use and utilization:

According to a paper published in the journal food policy based on 2011 census data, 3 out of 4 people living in rural India cannot afford a nutritious diet. Even if they spent their entire income on food, almost 2 out of 3 would not be able to afford the cheapest possible diet fulfilling requirements. 330 gm of cereals, 75 gm of pulses a day, 300 gm of dairy, 100 gm of fruit, and 300 gm of vegetables which should include at least 100 gm of dark green leafy vegetables are required for a nutritionally adequate diet for adult women as per the guidelines by the National Institute for Nutrition.

We know that the main factor in deciding how much a person needs to eat is calorific value but rarely is it seen from where those calorific values are getting, below table shows how much calorific value a portion of nuts, fresh fruits, and salads contain.

**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Uv3ZOkAbr7-EQIKtrhKpt4JFECLpuhkCxh6F6CwYK3w9Te9HQLZ7GujanevD6zrzE0xp6Q7NUjI2BbVnPfE0GMrQICV_-lnS2Y5UFYABHel-z6N7iw_6cjed_yh5CV40yzBGSvMH)**

To ensure proper food utilization, people need a balanced diet consisting of all such essential nutrients with appropriate calories according to their level of activity and other things.
Some steps we can take to ensure proper food utilization in rural areas are:

-   An information program should be started in rural India, educating them on how much minimum food of various types they need to maintain a healthy lifestyle.   
-   A more village targeted logistics and planning system should be developed so that each village can grow whatever farmers are comfortable with ( planning as such a group of villages fulfill all dietary needs locally ), so that cost can be brought down ( logistical and transport, the whole village is in either support of one type of crop so supply chain cost can be brought down and increased specialization in that particular crop or fruit will increase productivity ).
-   A community kitchen can be established, where the village as a whole works as a single co-operative unit, and co-operative kitchen feeds the whole village, this will result in a more organized structure, thus it will be easy to maintain a nutrition profile.  
-   Free or cheap ration provided by Public Distribution System should also monitor the nutritional needs of a family through some portal or app which need to be updated by ration distributors in rural areas, and a predictive ML model should be implemented to predict the target of providing nutritious diet in each household eradicating the major problem of malnutrition.    
-   Awareness programs need to be conducted and strict monitoring on the nutritional level in maternal diet and diet of children in the age group of 1-5 needs to be done. Involvement of women is more important because meals of the family are looked after by mothers in rural India and women's participation encourages other women of the village also.
- Effective food utilization depends in large measure on knowledge within the household of food storage and processing techniques. This is because most people in rural areas have very little knowledge of how to store and refrigerate things. Therefore, proper awareness of refrigeration guidelines should be publicized using the packaging of packed food and using radio and tv commercials for no packaged food.

#### Long term self-sustaining solutions:

The extent of economic and political independence defines whether a particular region will thrive or not. This is the main key point in ensuring food security in rural areas. We have to make nutritious food economically and politically sustainable, not like the communist setup where micromanaging led to mass famines and malnutrition. We can have government-supported cooperative capitalism, where the government supports the creation of co-operatives that will run farms, schools, community kitchens as a corporate house for less than 40% of the partnership of government. The community kitchen and schools (which teaches about nutrition profile) should have village members as board members advised by an expert from the government or some NGO. Some of these cooperatives with the help of the government have a strong regional or even a national presence( for appropriate government partnership in profit, less than 50%).
These regional cooperatives will work with the government and private NGOs to make affordable food available to the rural people. Also along with bringing the cost down, the quality of crops should not be compromised. Specialized cross-breed crops with more nutritional value and dairy should be produced with the help of the government and these cooperatives to achieve self-reliance and thereby ensure food security.

  
### [5. Healthcare](#table-of-contents)
    
## Problem:

**Ineffective diagnosis of symptoms which leads to villagers taking
longer to get the right treatment leading to loss of their precious time
and money.**

## Solution:

Products like digital BP measurer, pulse-oximeter and thermometer should
be readily available at local village medical centers so that villagers
should be precisely able to know about symptoms they are suffering for
better treatment. On an average, a digital BP machine costs Rs.900, a
pulse-oximeter costs Rs.750 and a thermometer(digital) costs Rs.150.
Government of India has granted Rs.8454 crores for improving healthcare
facilities in rural India which means that every village has been
granted about Rs.22 Lakhs on an average, hence these instruments can be
easily afforded by the health centers. 

## Problem:

**Diseases such as Tuberculosis ,whooping cough, respiratory infections,
pneumonia are highly contagious and infectious which may become severe
and cause of death for rural people especially for pregnant ladies and
infants.**

## Solution: 

Seminars should be conducted online on smartphones provided to poor
rural people under government schemes to make villagers aware of the
importance of water purification and should be taught scientific methods
to purify water using household equipment. Science tested Techniques
like filtration, sedimentation, Solar disinfection, Slow sand
filtration, Upflow gravel filter etc should be taught and necessary
equipment should be provided to them.

## Problem:

**Villages don’t have enough doctors and hospitals.**

## Solution:

Remote access or virtual consultations is the need of the hour in
villages. Villagers should be made aware about the online medical
consultation. Government should make an android application and website
for providing free medical consultation to people of rural India  or
villagers should be provided a healthcare scheme under a government
scheme so that they can cover expenses of the virtual consultation
platforms like practo and apollo 24/7.

## Problem:

**People try to self-medicate by using home remedies or witchcraft
(black magic), which might actually worsen their health.**

## Solution:

People should be educated on the benefits of receiving professional
medical care rather than attempting to self-treat or refer to
witchcraft. Various virtual seminars, some animated series and online
advertisements should be promoted on the Aarogya setu app or on
entertainment platforms. The government should introduce virtual
consultation platforms as they would save both time and money for the
person. Health-related start-ups should be encouraged by the government
as well. In remote regions, they can establish a platform that combines
everything from online consultations to the purchase of medication to
the scheduling of health checkups.

## Problem:

**Lack of advisory to the doctor and maintenance of reports.**

## Solution:

Integrating digital information to improve health care efficiency and
accessibility. At any time, a doctor can turn to a support system for
his clinical decision, which will aid him in making the right choice.
When it comes to electronic health records (EHRs), patients no longer
have to take them around with them. Additional to that, the adoption of
digital prescriptions is expected to eliminate prescription errors.

## Problem:

**Unavailability of Medicinal Drugs in Rural areas**

## Solution: 

Government should establish some type of partnership with transport
agencies like uber, and with individual transport vehicle workers like
antoes, to make new apps available to rural areas, through which we can
place an order for medicines we need.

## Problem:

**Less than 10 percent of the rural population uses toilets and have a
lack of sanitary conditions.**

## Solution:

Villagers firstly should be educated about how to maintain good hygiene
and what are the benefits of it. It can be done through interactive
videos and online sessions directly on their mobile phones or through
community events organized by various NGOs and govt. organizations.
Other than that, the government should deploy mobile apps which can be
used by villagers to inform the government about bad conditions of
toilets and other hygiene facilities in their village and then the
government can use this information to take needful actions.

## Problem

**Disposal of solid waste**

## Solution

**Biodegradable**

-   Composting

Composting can be done with any organic waste, such as vegetable waste,
garden trash, agricultural waste, cow manure, and so on. Meat scraps and
bones, as well as very greasy waste, should be avoided because they
attract rodents and insects and cause odors. Composting can be done
successfully in any corner of a house yard or field without the need for
a structure. A compost pit, on the other hand, may retain heat, which
helps to speed up the composting process while also improving
aesthetics.

-   Vermicomposting

Unlike traditional composting, which relies on natural processes to
break down organic matter, vermicomposting employs a variety of worm
species to break down organic matter and produce nutrient-rich compost.
A vermi-tank or a vermi-bed can be used for vermicomposting.

**Non-biodegradable**

-   Recycling

Waste such as plastic, glass, metal, and so on can be sold to a
kabadiwala.

## Problem

**Open defecation and improper waste management is still prominent in
many villages which contaminates surroundings and contributes to the
spread of many infectious diseases.**

## Solution

The government should provide gram panchayats and local municipalities
with special grants for scientific waste management. Despiste of
disposing the garbage in pits , it should be used as a source of energy.
Municipalities should implement technology to convert garbage into
manure and use it to generate fuel.

## Problem

**Poor Sanitation**

## Solution

The pit toilet and the flush toilet are the two most widely utilized
sanitation systems today. Waterborne sewage has been shown to be
ineffective in meeting sanitation needs in poor countries. Because the
systems are too expensive to deliver to everyone, they are usually
limited to the top and middle classes. Currently, almost 90% of sewage
in developing-country cities is released untreated, damaging rivers,
lakes, and coastal areas. Pit toilets have their own set of drawbacks,
particularly in highly populated places, where they pose a serious risk
of contaminating groundwater.

## Problem

**Residential burning of wood and other biomass used predominantly for
cooking and heating causing pollution.**

## Solution

Ventilation plays an important part in reducing smoke and health risks,
and the locals should be made aware of this. Subsidized better stoves
can be offered to the rural people. The Integrated Rural Energy Planning
Scheme can provide free upgraded stoves with chimneys (i.e. smoke-less
earthen stoves) to the poorest segment of the tribal region in order to
avoid the health risks associated with the consumption of fuel wood. The
poor and middle-class should be discouraged from using clay pots and
should be insisted on using aluminum kitchenware, pressure cookers, and
energy-efficient stoves in order to minimize fuel wood usage and air
pollution. The wealthier people in society can be insisted for shifting
to biogas/gas stoves by offering them loans and subsidies.

## Problem

**Disposal of Liquid waste**

## Solution 

**Types of Liquid waste : waste water, fats, used oils, sludges or
hazardous household liquids.** There are 6 commonly used processes for
disposal of liquid waste. But incineration is the best method for
disposal of hazardous liquid waste. The heat produced by a multiple
hearth furnace will dispose of hazardous wastes like acids, scrap
materials, slag, rock tailings, oils, and other chemicals. Any water
left behind is clear and free of contaminants.

## Problem

**25% of rural India’s households don’t have access to sanitation and
about 42.9% of the households in the rural areas used hand pump as the
principal source of drinking water**

## Solution

Villagers don’t know about what are the harms of this poor sanitization
and how it is affecting them so, they should be educated about this
through various interactive online courses or videos about it in their
own language so that they can understand the benefits. Government should
also take help from these villagers to identify the villages with this
problem. They can deploy an app in which villagers can put in the
request for a proper toilet and drinking water source for their area and
can also get rewards for this task. This way the Govt can identify and
easily solve the problem.

## Long term self-sustainable model

To make sure that the healthcare and cleanliness of the village are
self-sustainable in the long term, an independent committee needs to be
formed that should take care of all the matters concerning cleanliness
and healthcare and also make sure that the solutions suggested are being
acted upon efficiently. The committee should act independently without
interference from any third party. The committee should have a
well-defined structure with a president and a board of members and
elections should be held regularly every 3 years for each position of
the board and the post of president with voters being all villagers
above 18 years of age. For the first president and board of members,
interviews should be held to make sure that they understand the problems
and their technical solutions and they should also be able to educate
the villagers about the same.
